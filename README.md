# Astable Multivibrator using EASYEDA PCB Design

## 🛠 Project Overview

This project involves the design and simulation of an **Astable Multivibrator** circuit using **EASYEDA**, an online PCB design and simulation platform. The circuit generates a continuous square wave signal without requiring any external triggering. It is commonly used for timer circuits, blinking LEDs, and oscillator applications.

---

## 🔧 Circuit Description

An **Astable Multivibrator** is a two-stage oscillator where both stages switch between HIGH and LOW states continuously. It typically uses:

* **Two NPN Transistors (e.g., BC547 or 2N3904)**
* **Two capacitors**
* **Four resistors**
* **Two LEDs (optional for visual output)**

This configuration ensures that the transistors alternately turn on and off, causing the output to oscillate.

## 🚦 Working Principle

1. Initially, one transistor turns on, charging the capacitor connected to the base of the other transistor.
2. As the capacitor charges, it eventually causes the second transistor to turn on and the first to turn off.
3. This process repeats indefinitely, generating a square wave output.

---

## 🔬 Simulation (Optional)

You can simulate the design directly within **EASYEDA**:

* Check LED blinking intervals
* Measure frequency and duty cycle of output waveform
* Modify component values to tune frequency
